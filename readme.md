## Methodology

More text will go here

All the data was collected using the WCL API and processed with R v.4.1 (R Development Core Team).

Ideally this repository should eventually have both the raw data used and all the code used to generate both the tables and the graphics.

### LIMITATIONS

a.k.a. Things to consider when interpreting this as "information"


- Not all logs are public. Given it is on the interest of some guilds to make their logs private on PTR due to the competitive nature of "progression" rewards (lumberjack rankings, in-game title, larping), this statistics are more biased towards a more casual playerbase. (I.E. less kills, more wipes, longer kill times).


- Not everyone has logs of their runs. Probably a minority, if you think most players are in a somewhat well-informed communities. Or it could be a great majority of players not logging their runs if you think most of the playerbase is "casual" and doesn't care about logging.


- PTR  means a portion of the players have either incomplete or scuffed UIs/macros/addons, making the overrall performance of the average player worse than what it actually is in live servers. Another group of the PTR players could also be testing specs and gear.
